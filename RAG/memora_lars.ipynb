The artifact we created (DLL or exe)\\ncontains CIL code, CIL is an intermediate language. All .NET language\\ncompilers compile the code to CIL artifact.\\nWhen we want to run the artifact the CLR converts the CIL code to native\\ncode in runtime.\\nThe different between DLL and exe\\nDLL and exe files are the output artifacts of the common language\\ncompilers. They contain the CIL assembly (the CIL code) and CIL metadata.\\nUnlike exe, DLL is not runnable because of one simple reason: every .NET\\nexecutable file must have an entry point to start from, the main function.\\nDLL doesn’t contain this function and therefore not runnable.\\nWindows run PE (Portable executable) files, such as exe, that contains either\\nnative code or CIL code. Because Microsoft is the creator of windows and\\n.NET not like JAVA, they could use the same PE files for .NET assemblies and\\nnative assemblies. They accomplished this by adding a header in the\\nassembly that indicates if either or not the CLR needs to run the assembly.\\nWhy compiling to CIL and not to native code\\nThe use of the CIL artifact in .NET platform empowers us for many reasons:\\n· Cross Platform — Native code can run only on a specific machine — the one\\ncompiled for.

This reason helps full, makes\\nthe code simple decreasing chances for bugs, this kind of code calls\\nmanaged code.\\n.NET’s garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for\\nyour application. Each time you create a new object, the CLR allocates\\nmemory for the object from the managed heap. As long as address space is\\navailable in the managed heap, the CLR continues to allocate space for new\\nobjects. However, memory is not infinite. Eventually, the garbage collector\\nmust perform a collection in order to free some memory.\\n· Error handling — Thanks to the JIT compiler, .NET platform can support\\neasy error handling in your application code. When an error occurs, instead\\nof terminate the process the CLR throw error event.\\n· Thread management — In the .Net platform, the CLR is responsible for\\nallocate resources for running applications. In particular, the CLR thread\\npool determines when threads are to be added or taken away.\\n· Performance optimization — When converting the CIL code to native code\\nThe JIT compiler optimizes the code for the machine platform and CPU, and\\ntherefore the application performance improved.\\nConclusion', '11/28/23, 9:58 AM .NET behind the scene.
